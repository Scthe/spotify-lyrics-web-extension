# duo - complex meta lines

META::[Verse 1: Borislav Slavov]
I feel your breath upon my neck
A soft caress as cold as death (Cold as death)
I didn't know you well back then
I blame it all on luck and vain (Luck and vain)
Your blood like wine, I wanted in
Oh darling, get me drunk and make me feel

META::[Chorus: Borislav Slavov]
It's not my fault
I'm not to blame
These ain't my sins
I broke my chains
There's more to do
And I still want to live

META::[Verse 2: Ilona Ivanova]
I feel your breath, upon my neck
A soft caress, as cold as death (Cold as death)
I feel your heart-beat in my soul
Our futures bound, our bodies know (Bodies know)
Your blood like wine, I wanted in
Oh darling get me drunk, invite me in

META::[Chorus: Ilona Ivanova]
It's not my fault
I'm not to blame
Thesе ain't my sins
I broke my chains
There's morе to do
If I can only live

META::[Bridge: Borislav Slavov & Ilona Ivanova]
I can't go yet
Don't let me die
I'll never stop
Until I'm done
But just tonight
Maybe I'll rest in peace

META::[Chorus: Borislav Slavov & Ilona Ivanova]
I feel your breath upon my neck
A soft caress as cold as death (Cold as death)
I hear your heart-beat in my soul
Our endings bound, our bodies know

META::[Outro: Ilona Ivanova, Borislav Slavov, Ilona Ivanova & Borislav Slavov]
I can't go yet
Don't let me die
I want to live
My only one
There's more to do, if we can only live
The clock won't stop and this is what we get
