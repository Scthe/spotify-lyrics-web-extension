Steven said why not write something thats not so deep
and meaningful, but the truth can be
so tragic and beautiful.

Blake said she could never tell anyone just how she feels,
how will anyone know, well,
she caves in and it all gets real.

I wanna bury my soul, in a way no one can know
in the hope that somewhere you might understand how it feels...

to be so alone

Cassandra said she lost the plug
when she stopped the car to drop me off

I was to disappear, my face reflecting in the
rear-view mirror.

Sophie woke me at the dead of night
to tell me how her dad had died

I lay there in the dark, now theres
no where left to hide.

I wanna bury my soul, in a way no one can know
in the hope that somewhere you might understand how it feels...

to be so alone
