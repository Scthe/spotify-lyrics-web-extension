META::[verse]
Children of the land, do you hear
Echoes of truths that once rang clear?
Two souls intertwined
One true love they did find
Bringing land and heavens near

But flames that burned full bright, soon fell dark
Memories dimmed by shadowed hearts
In the waxing gloom, did wane the lovers′ moon
Watching as their worlds drift apart

One soul's cry, a passion dwelling within
Sacrifice, a final plea to her kin
Yet this bond of hope, by treachery was broke
Scattering her words to the wind

Swelling over long
Seas of blood are a song
And death an afterthought
To those who fight for naught

A throne lying empty
A reign incomplete
Alone for eternity
A pain without cease

Children of the land, answer this;
Why must you turn to empty bliss?
Tell me why break trust, why turn the past to dust
Seeking solace in the abyss?
Tell me why create a circle none can break?
Why must you let go, the life you were bestowed?
This I fear I′ll never know
Never know
