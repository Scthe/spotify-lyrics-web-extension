META::[verse]
I feel your breath upon my neck
A soft caress as cold as death (cold as death)
I didn′t know you well back then
I blame it all on luck and vain (luck and vain)
Your blood like wine, I wanted in
Oh darling, get me drunk and make me feel

META::[chorus]
It's not my fault
I′m not to blame
These ain't my sins
I broke my chains
There's more to do
And I still want to live (live)

META::[verse]
I feel your breath upon my neck
A soft caress as cold as death (cold as death)
I feel your heartbeat in my soul
Our futures bound, our bodies know (bodies know)
Your blood like wine, I wanted in
Oh darling, get me drunk, invite me in

META::[chorus]
It′s not my fault
I′m not to blame
Thesе ain't my sins
I broke my chains
There′s morе to do
If I can only live (live)

META::[bridge]
I can't go yet, don′t let me die
I'll never stop until I′m done
But just tonight, maybe I'll rest in peace

META::[chorus]
I feel your breath upon my neck
A soft caress as cold as death (cold as death)
I hear your heartbeat in my soul
Our endings bound, our bodies know

META::[outro]
I can't go yet, don′t let me die
I want to live, my only one
There′s more to do, if we can only live
The clock won't stop and this is what we get
