Stephen said why not write something...
...that’s not so deep and meaningful?
But the truth can be so...
...tragic and beautiful

Blythe said she could never...
...tell anyone just how she feels
How will anyone know when...
...she caves in and it all gets real?

META::[Chorus]
I want to bare my soul in a way that no one can
In the hope that some of you might understand
How it feels to be so alone
...to be so alone
...to be so alone

Cassandra said she’d lost the plot...
...when she stopped the car to drop me off
I watched her disappear
Her face reflected in the rear-view mirror

Sophie woke me in the dead of night...
...to tell me how her dad had died
I lie here in the dark but...
...now there’s nowhere left to hide

META::[Chorus]
