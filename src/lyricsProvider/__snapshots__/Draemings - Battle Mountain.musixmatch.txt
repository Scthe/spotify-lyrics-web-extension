Wild youth, I was a terror
Red mouth warrior, ill-dates bearer
Of the days that lived in the sun
Calls me from an unlisted number
Husky voice, love me like I′m younger
Remember what I used to be

This is the end, then I don't wanna fight it
If there′s hope, I know we'll find it
If this is the end, then I don't wanna fight it
If there′s hope, I know we′ll find it

Hide here, who's watching this?
The world caught on my breath
The legend I love is a miserable lover
Breathe in the air that I breathe out
Like waves, we speak in rolling tongues
I can′t get stuck cause life keeps moving on

This is the end, then I don't wanna fight it
If there′s hope, I know we'll find it
If this is the end, then I don′t wanna fight it
If there's hope, I know we'll find it
